          Write a small web application to check if a graph is red-blue colorable.<br />
          A graph is red-blue colorable if two connected nodes have never the same color and the graph is a connected graph. A user should be able to enter a graph in a textarea by typing some paths (a word is a node, a dash an edge and a new line or a comma a separation between paths).

          A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. This means that there is a path between every pair of vertices. An undirected graph that is not connected is called disconnected. An undirected graph G is therefore disconnected if there exist two vertices in G such that no path in G has these vertices as endpoints. A graph with just one vertex is connected. An edgeless graph with two or more vertices is disconnected.
